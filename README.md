## üå± What This Project Does

Proteins naturally fold into 3D shapes that minimize their internal energy ‚Äî a process that‚Äôs incredibly complex to simulate.  
This project recreates that process *in miniature*, using a **tiny 3D lattice** and a simplified **3-letter amino acid alphabet**:

| Letter | Type | Effect on Energy |
|:------:|:------|:----------------|
| **H** | Hydrophobic | Favors contact with other H‚Äôs |
| **P** | Polar | Neutral interactions |
| **C** | Charged | Penalized for adjacent charged pairs |

Each ‚Äúprotein‚Äù chain has 6 residues placed in a **2√ó3√ó1 grid**, forming a linear chain that folds according to energy rules.  
We then use **Simulated Annealing** (and optionally **Hybrid Annealing**) to find the lowest-energy configuration.

## üîç Why It‚Äôs Cool

- üßä Demonstrates **optimization in high-dimensional search spaces**  
- üß† Bridges classical and quantum-inspired approaches (SA ‚Üî HA)  
- üî¨ Makes real protein folding ideas understandable on a toy scale  
- ‚è±Ô∏è Tracks energy changes, temperature schedules, and time per run  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Each run:
1. Randomly generates a sequence (e.g. `HPCPHC`)
2. Places residues in a 2√ó3√ó1 lattice
3. Computes total energy  
   \[
   E = E_{MJ} + Œª_1E_1 + Œª_2E_2 + Œª_3E_3
   \]
4. Iteratively improves it using **Simulated Annealing**:
   - Randomly swaps or moves residues  
   - Accepts worse states probabilistically (temperature-dependent)
5. Optionally validates against **brute-force enumeration (256 configs)**

Graph output (via Matplotlib) shows energy vs temperature and the best configuration found.

## üí° Methods and Background

This implementation borrows the general energy formulation from **Irb√§ck et al. (2025)**, which introduces lattice folding on minimal surfaces, and adapts it to a simpler 3-letter system for clarity.

## üß™ Getting Started

### Requirements
```bash
  pip install numpy matplotlib
```
### Run
```bash
  # Simulated Annealing (legacy entrypoint preserved)
  python3 simulated_annealing.py

  # Hybrid Annealing (legacy entrypoint preserved)
  python3 hybrid_annealing.py
```
### üîß Configuration

You can tweak parameters in config.py or at the top of main.py:

TEMPERATURE_STEPS: number of temperature levels (default: 25)

SWEEPS_PER_TEMP: number of iterations per temperature

ALPHA: cooling rate for geometric schedule

SEQUENCE: choose your protein sequence (e.g., HPCPHC, HHPPCC, etc.)

These allow quick experimentation with annealing depth, chain type, and cooling behavior.

### üìä Visualization

After each run the program writes plots to the `plots/` directory with subfolders
for each method:

- `plots/sa/` ‚Äî simulated annealing outputs
- `plots/ha/` ‚Äî hybrid annealing outputs

You can enable live plotting during execution by setting:
```python
LIVE_PLOT = True
```

### üß© Example Experiments

Try adjusting the parameters to see how annealing affects convergence:

| Experiment | Description | Expected Behavior |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `ALPHA = 0.95` | Slow cooling | More thorough exploration, slower runtime |
| `ALPHA = 0.70` | Fast cooling | Quicker but more likely to get stuck |
| `SWEEPS_PER_TEMP = 1000` | Longer per step | Better convergence for small systems |
| `SEQUENCE = 'HCHCHC'` | Alternating charges | Higher penalties, more complex landscape |

## üè° House-Keeping

### üß† What‚Äôs Next

- Add true Hybrid Annealing integration (mixing classical + quantum subroutines)

- Visualize 3D lattice states with matplotlib or PyVista

- Extend to larger lattice (3√ó3√ó3) and more complex alphabets (HP or HP+C variants)
